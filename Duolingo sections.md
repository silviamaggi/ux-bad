# Duoling sections

## Is that an accordion?

Tapping on the arrow takes you to the full-screen carousel in the second screenshot. That arrow: it looks like an accordion, which usually is on the right-hand side. I’m still expecting for the Explorer section to collapse when I tap it. But it doesn’t.

*Continue* take you to the current lesson. Swiping right, you see the other sections: they're not active, but it’s possible to jump to them.

*Review* takes you to the first Unit of the section, which is an operation one can perform also on the main screen (learning path).

## Section naming

### Swedish course

1. Rookie
2. Explorer
3. Traveler
4. Champion

### French course

1. Rookie
2. Explorer
3. Traveler
4. Trailblazer
5. Adventurer
6. Discoverer
7. Daredevil
8. Champion

Well, that’s very confusing. I already knew that the Swedish course is shorter. It means that I won’t reach a great proficiency once I’m finished. I will certainly know more about the French language, though.

Because of the way we universally measure proficiency, isn't it confusing – misleading, even – that both courses end with a *Champion* section? Arguably, anyone finishing the Swedish course on Duolingo will be at *Trailblazer* level.

## What is the problem they were trying to solve?

1. The new learning path is longer than the previous. Scrolling up or down to reach previous or next units can be cumbersome. This might have raised the need for different means of navigation. 

2. Previously, the units were grouped under categories (e.i. basics 1, basics 2, phrases, plurals and so on). Now the units are numbered. A short description gives hints on its contents. It’s possible that people found it tricky to placed themselves along the learning path. It still impossible to find that unit or lesson where you learned numbers, though.

3. It might be an element of gamification. Which brings to the copy, which might not be everyone cup of tea. *Rookie* and *Beginner* are very different words. (The choice depends on Duolingo’s user base).
